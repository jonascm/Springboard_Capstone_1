Hotel recommendation system

According to the 2016 Tripadvisor trip barometer, most travelers decide their destination based on the airline tickets, and after that they look for a convenient accommodation, which accounts for the most time spent once the destination is decided. A personalized recommender system that knows the clientsâ€™ preferences and experiences can have a significant impact in the hotel search process, facilitating their decision-making steps and reducing the user efforts, thus improving the user experience.
In this project, I will implement two hotel recommender systems capable of suggesting the hotels may fit the user better based on either previous stays and based on people similar users. Both results will we provided with a meaningful score. A model-based cold-start solution will be provided.
The system will be made publicly available as a website.
